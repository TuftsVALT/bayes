> The probability of breast cancer is 1% for women at age forty who participate in routine screening. If a woman has breast cancer, the probability is 80% that she will get a positive mammography. If a woman does not have breast cancer, the probability is 9.6% that she will also get a positive mammography.

> A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening. What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?

This repo contains the experiment data for our [InfoVis '15 paper](http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~alvittao/files/bayes.pdf).

There are two datasets-- one for [Experiment 1: Text-Only Representations](https://github.com/TuftsVALT/bayes/blob/master/data_experiment1.csv), and one for [Experiment 2: Text and Visualization](https://github.com/TuftsVALT/bayes/blob/master/data_experiment2.csv).
